üß† Conductor AI ‚Äî Local Orchestration for Distributed Cognition
Overview:
Conductor AI is a browser-based orchestration hub that empowers users to control and coordinate multiple AI chat agents (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, local models) from a unified interface. It eliminates the inefficiency of switching tabs and copy-pasting prompts by centralizing prompt dispatch, response comparison, and cognitive workflow management ‚Äî all inside the browser.

Key Principles:

No backend. No scraping. No cloud dependency.
All sessions are user-initiated and stored locally. The browser becomes the runtime ‚Äî not just the interface.

Live, Authenticated Tab Control:
Using pre-injected content scripts and browser automation, Conductor leverages the user‚Äôs active sessions to simulate human interactions with AI platforms.

Extensible Control Surface:
The dashboard functions as a local cognitive cockpit ‚Äî allowing prompt routing, session tracking, and synthesis across diverse agents.

üîß How It Works
System Architecture:

Browser Extensions + Content Scripts:
Preloads JavaScript into AI chat tabs to inject prompts, observe DOM changes, and extract outputs without scraping or violating TOS.

Central Orchestration Layer (Background Script):
Coordinates agent interactions, manages session state, and updates the UI in real time.

Dashboard UI:
A unified interface that lets users direct input to one or more models, receive structured outputs, and initiate synthesis workflows.

Interaction Flow:

User enters a prompt in the Conductor dashboard.

The orchestrator dispatches that prompt to selected models via tab automation.

Each AI model responds in its native UI, observed by content scripts.

Responses are captured and returned to the dashboard for comparison, synthesis, or further delegation.

üß© What It Enables
Power-user Intelligence Workflows:

Prompt broadcasting with one click

Side-by-side agent response comparison

Iterative synthesis and routing chains

Role-based prompt delegation

Emergent Use Cases:

Cross-model synthesis with task-aware routing

Reusable orchestration patterns (e.g. ‚ÄúResearch ‚Üí Synthesize ‚Üí Refine‚Äù)

Local-first knowledge workflows (stored context, session recall)

Plug-and-play extensions for reasoning templates

üß≠ Strategic Direction
Short-Term Focus:

Solidify prompt routing and response capture across major platforms

Implement synthesis router: intelligent model selection based on prompt type

Build a template library for reusable cognitive workflows

Mid-Term Goals:

Add memory anchoring, local recall, and version tracking

Enable agent role assignment per task (e.g. "Critique", "Summarize", "Prototype")

Design feedback loops for multi-agent iteration

Long-Term Vision:

Treat the browser as a cognitive substrate ‚Äî orchestrating human+AI reasoning across any tool that runs in a tab.

Transition from input-output relaying to orchestration intelligence ‚Äî enabling dynamic, feedback-aware workflows.

Support AI-native operating systems for researchers, strategists, and developers.
